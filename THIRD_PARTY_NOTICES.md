# Third-party notices

Invoicer's own source code is MIT licensed. Third-party libraries retain their licenses; complete package notices are distributed by their npm packages and listed in the lockfile.

| Vite, Vitest, TypeScript, Wrangler and associated development packages | See individual package licenses | Installed only as development tooling |
| Noto Sans, Noto Serif, Noto Sans Mono fonts | SIL Open Font License 1.1 | https://github.com/notofonts/noto-fonts |

The Noto font license is preserved beside the bundled files at `public/fonts/OFL.txt`. These fonts are neither rebranded nor sold independently.

The fontkit package declares MIT licensing in its upstream README; that declaration is preserved at `public/licenses/fontkit-UPSTREAM-README.md` because the published package does not contain a separate license file. Other runtime package license files are preserved under `public/licenses`.

PDF.js copyright and Apache-2.0 license: https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/master/LICENSE. The shipped worker bundle retains the upstream license banner. A full copy is included at `public/licenses/pdfjs-LICENSE`.

No proprietary Invoice Generator code or artwork is included. Minvoice and worker-generate-invoice-pdf are architectural references; their source code is not included in this implementation.
